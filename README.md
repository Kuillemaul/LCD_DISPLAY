# LCD_DISPLAY

Playing with 128x64 LCD screen for later integration with MID LEDS

What I want it to do:

Display starting logo and information on what mode you are in.

Play mode     : Display logo. Once the display is drawn it should have no impact on performance.
Pattern Mode  : Display pattern name 
Edit mode     : Tell user to hit pad to edit
Color edit    : Show pad name and current color. Change with encoder input (Ideally want have the color "name" not numbers. An array of CRGB colors?)
Fade edit     : Show pad and fade speed
